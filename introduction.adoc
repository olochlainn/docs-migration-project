== Repos

We need to map the repos containing Asciidoc documentation to the modules presented by the online help UI. Several repo configurations are possible:

* A repo contains a single docs module
* A repo contains multiple docs modules
* The docs module(s) may be nested within the repo

In turn, a module in the UI can be mapped to a single repo, or draw content from multiple repos.
