= Introduction to docs migration project

== Repos

We need to map the repos containing Asciidoc documentation to the modules presented by the online help UI. Several repo configurations are possible:

* A repo contains a single docs module
* A repo contains multiple docs modules
* The docs module(s) may be nested within the repo

In turn, a module in the UI can be mapped to a single repo, or draw content from multiple repos.

== Antora

Antora is the static site generator (SSG) that takes the Asciidoc content from the repos and generates a website from it, delivering the online documentation.

Antora requires a specific directory organization within the repo, and some configuration files. These details will be provided by the Technical Writer (TW).

The simplest configuration is a repo dedicated to a single module. The most basic version contains the following:

----
antora.yml
modules/
  module-example1/
    nav.adoc
    pages/
      page-content1.adoc
----
